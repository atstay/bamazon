Welcome to bamazon! 
This is a mock amazon software that allows customers to buy from an inventory list. The sever then updates the inventory and gives the customer the total cost.

To run this first install mysql and inquirer (npm install " ") in terminal. Then run the js file with "node node.js" in terminal

Afterwards follow the prompts in the terminal console to "order" from the server and see the quantity update automatically with each purchase!
